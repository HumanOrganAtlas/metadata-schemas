# Human Organ Atlas metadata schemas
Metadata schemas for the Human Organ Atlas data.

## Metadata location
The actual metadata are stored in two locations:

1. As individual JSON files (that conform to the schemas here) with each dataset, that can be downloaded from the [Human Organ Atlas website](https://human-organ-atlas.esrf.eu/).
2. As comma separated value (CSV) tables in the [`metadata-inventory` repository](https://github.com/HumanOrganAtlas/metadata-inventory).
